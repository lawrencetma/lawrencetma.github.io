        <a href="http://q-ing.herokuapp.com" target="_blank"><h2>Q-ing</h2></a>
          <p>
            Q-ing is a crowd-sourced, timing app that provides users the information needed to avoid long lines at eateries, bathrooms, and other attractions.<br><br>  Users can check average wait times, submit their own time and add new locations.  Q-ing uses the Google Maps API to determine and track locations and the Yelp API to provide relevant alternatives of nearby businesses. Q-ing, avoid the traffic of life.
          </p>
        <h3>Development</h3>
          <p>
            I along with 3 team members created Q-ing as a client side app that utilized the Google Maps API as well as the Yelp API
          </p>
          <p>
            The app is mostly javascript with a Ruby on Rails back end which serves mostly as an API.  We put together the app in just over a week as our final project at DevBoot Camp
          </p>
          <p>
            Check out the app at our heroku site: <a href="http://q-ing.herokuapp.com" target="_blank">Q-ing</a>

          <p>
            Mark Noce is a historical fiction writer who has two books that are about to be published that are based in medieval Wales.<br><br>  On his site, Mark wanted readers to be able to read his blog, contact him and check out his other literary works including other books and short stories.
          </p>
        <h3>Development</h3>
          <p>
            Mark wanted a visually appealing site with some interactivity without being too loud.  I suggested we use a parallax effect along with using bootstrap to give the site a clean feel.<br><br>  Along with bootstrap I'm using javascript and jquery for the visual effects and the site has a ruby on rails back end.
          </p>
          <p>

					<h1 id="post_head">How Do I...?: The Art of Asking Good Questions</h1>
						<p>
							Asking questions is one the most important things in life and something we should be doing every day.  Everyone does it, but the trick is to do it well.  So what goes into coming up with a great question?
							<br><br>
							From my limited research on the matter, I think the first thing you must think about in asking a question is: What do I want?  In other words, think about the answer you want and work backwards.  If you want a detailed explanation of how to do something, include that into the framework of your question.
							<br><br>
							Another handy tip for coming up with a good question is to read over your own question and try to answer it yourself.  Does the question make sense?  Does it allow for a specific answer and is open ended enough for an answerer to give some insight rather than simply a yes or no?  Most importantly, does the question make sense when you read it?
							<br><br>
							So what happens if you're not making sense or your question isn't specific enough?  You might need to add something to your question that will help people understand what you're asking.  Here are a few things you might want to add or check on:
							<br><br>
							<ul>
								<li>Context</li>
								<li>Research</li>
								<li>Spelling/Grammar</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
						<h2 id="post_head">Context</h2>
						<p>
							Including the right amount of context in your question can help people understand what you are asking by giving them background on what it is your question is about.  Perhaps you can include what you've already tried in answering your own question, or providing what the setting was for your problem.  The more context you provide the easier it is for someone to narrow down what your actual problem is and therefore make it easier for someone to solve it.  
						</p>
						<h2 id="post_head">Research</h2>
						<p>
							Doing research is basically just trying your best to answer your own question before asking others.  Sometimes the best learning you can do is during the process of trying to answer your own question through research.  Even if you ultimately cannot find your answer through that research, the process will narrow down what it is exactly that you want to ask, and will make your question more specific and undesrstandable.  
						</p>
						<h2 id="post_head">Spelling and Grammar</h2>
						<p>
							It might sound nitpicky but if you clean up your spelling and grammar in your questions they are just simply easier to read thus making it easier for someone to respond rather than having somoene attempt to guess as to what it is you meant to write.  Included in this is that questions should be formatted in a way that is easily understood by a reader so make sure to proof read your question before submitting them.
						</p>
						<p>
							If you can do all these things you will be much better equipped to ask great questions.  One thing to note is that sometimes even if you've constructed an excellent question, the answers your recieve may not be what you might expect or what you need.  Although this could indicate that you could have tweaked your question even more, sometimes you just willl not get a great answer in response.  So try not to base how good your question is, solely on the answers your receive, but do take a look at each question you make and see what improvements could be made to garner better responses.
							<br><br>
							Questions are important when learning anything and asking questions while learning how to program is no different.  So ask some questions!

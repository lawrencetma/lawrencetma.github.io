							One problem that is facing the tech industry today may or may not be a problem depending on how you look at it.  That problem is that there is a shortage of talent in silicon valley and a huge amount of jobs that require that talent.<br><br>
							On first glance this seems like an excellent problem to have.  You're telling me that there are so many jobs out there for new programmers that there aren't even enough programmers to fill the openings?  Great!  But there are underlying problems here that need to be addressed.<br><br>
							The first problem is that without the necessary talent here at home, tech companies are forced to bring talent in from abroad.  Companies in Silicon Valley rely on the high skilled H1-B via program to bring in that talent quickly and without waiting around or overpaying for what little talent is here.  There are debates as to what the effect of this is on Americans in general, but I think most simply, it makes it harder for companies here to do business when they must go through the H1-B process in order to get qualified employees.<br><br>
							Secondly something this highlights is that the United States is trailing the rest of the world when it comes to education, especially in the realm of math and science.  It is well documented that the United States is below average compared to the world when it comes to math and science.  In 2012 the Program for International Student Assessment gave tests to 15 year olds throughout the globe and concluded that 29 countries outscored the United States.<br><br>
							In a lot of ways DBC and similar bootcamps are filling this very need.  Providing the job market with graduates who will be "expert beginners" and hit the ground running in tech companies.  It is one way this problem is being solved.  But I think in addition to this, math and science need to be taught in a way that can be applied easier at a younger age.  Children in schools need to realize that math and science can turn into something they want to be when they grow up.<br><br>
							There's probably not going to be a solution that comes along anytime soon, but I think all in all, it's not the worst problem to be having, just something that should be looked at if American students want to keep up with the rest of the world.

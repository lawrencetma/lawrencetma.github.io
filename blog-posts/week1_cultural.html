							Dev Boot Camp is not for everyone.
						</p>
						<p>
							Got that?  Okay now that we've gotten past that disclaimer, if I truly want to begin a path towards being a web developer Dev Boot Camp might just be the very best thing for me.
						</p>
						<p>
							$12,000 is not a small sum for any person.  I don't think anyone makes this decision lightly.  I weighed all my options, looked at other schools, other boot camp type programs and went through other application processes as well as debated just trying to continue learning on my own.  Although there were a multitude of different reasons why I decided to continue on with Dev Boot Camp, the reason I committed was what I perceived as a huge indicator of DBC's culture.
						</p>
						<p>
							That indicator was the Search Inside Yourself lecture by Chade Meng Tan <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3f0mrUZ0Ga8">video</a> that was required prior to the DBC interview.  
						</p>
						<p>
							What this indivated to me and what has been reminded to me over and over again including by Shereef in his fireside chat is this: DBC aims to change your way of thinking.  If you want to learn code and just get spit out with knowledge you could have learned by looking it up then DBC is not the place for you.  DBC is a culture that fosters growth as a person, growth as a thinker and growth in your emotional intelligence. 
						</p>
						<p>
							As straightforward as this seems, DBC is a place where you should only come to if you're open to the idea of improving yourself.  People will say, well sure that's any school, but it seems that DBC focuses on that mindset and tries to hammer that into you much more than learning actual code.
						</p>
						<p>
							The core of DBC, similarly to the core of the Search Inside Yourself series is that they are pinpointing what it is that we need to succeed and realizing that simply memorizing information is not the key to that success.
						</p>
						<p>
							This is why I decided to come to DBC and I get excited when I learn more about the culture of DBC because I believe this will be a great situation for me and that I hope to not just learn code, but to learn about learning, and not just be a better programmer, but be a better human being.

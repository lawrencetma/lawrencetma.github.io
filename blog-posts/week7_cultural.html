					<h2 id="post_head">Measuring Values</h2>
						<p>
							When looking at that giant list of values, I repeated to myself, happiest, proudest, most satisfied.  Although I could probably make a case for any of them I decided I would choose one value for each of those feelings.
						</p>
						<h3 id="post_head">Excitement</h3>

						<p>
							When I think of the happiest time in my life so far I think of Excitement. When my fiance said yes after I asked her to marry me, when the Giants won the World Series in 2010 and 2012 or even something as small as coming home after a long day to my dog happily jumping on me and trying to lick me.<br><br>
							All these things embody Excitement in some way or another and I think a lot of the happiest moments of my life are also exciting moments.<br><br>
							Although I know that I enjoy excitement in my life, often it's difficult to break out of the daily monotony and try something new, and try to obtain that excitement on my own.  I would say that on a scale of 1-5 I am a 3 or a 4 in living up to that value.
						</p>
						<h3 id="post_head">Accomplishment</h3>
						<img src="http://theguycancook.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/rocky_steps.jpg" align="left">
						<p>
							Accomplishment is a great feeling and something that emobidies what you are most proud of.  You had a difficult goal and you accomplished that goal through hard work.<br><br>
							When I think of things such as graduating from college or law school, passing the bar, or even completing last week's solo challenge, accomplishment is a great feeling at the end of a tough road.<br><br>
							One thing I loved from early on in phase 0 was the motivation technique where you would segment your work into little accomplishments instead of focusing only on the large accomplishment.<br><br>
							Instead of being discouraged that it would take so much work to accomplish a large goal, accomplishing small goals that contribute to that large goal make it a lot easier to motivate yourself to keep going.<br><br>
							I love that feeling of accomplishment and I try to live up to it every day by celebrating my small accomplishments as much as I can.  I feel I'm at a 4 on a scale of 1-5.
						</p>
						<h3 id="post_head">Friendships</h3>
						<p>
							I know I've been truly blessed in my life not only to have many close friends surrounding me who love and support me, but also that I can say that my family members are also some of my closest friends.  I'm very satisfied with my friendships and the relationships I've fostered with people in my life.<br><br>
							As far as friendships go I feel like there are times where I could have done more for my friends and been for them more often but I strive to be a great friend whenever possible.  I would say that I live up to my friendships value fairly well and would give myself a 4 out of 5 on that scale.
						</p>
						<h3 id="post_head">Advice</h3>
						<p>
							Last time I remember giving advice was probably a few weeks ago when I told my parents that even though they are getting older that it doesn't mean they can't improve themselves a little every day.<br><br>There are some things physically that will decline regardless of what you do, but the mind can be constantly improved and I encouraged my parents, my mom in particular to read more, and write more.  
						</p>
						<h3 id="post_head">Values and Stereotype Threat</h3>
						<p>
							When I think of my values in conjunction with stereotype threats or anything that might hamper my motivation or performance actually I think as long as I go back to keeping it simple and working on small accomplishments I'll be fine.<br><br>
							I always try to remind myself that no one learns something immediately, that it takes time, practice and patience.  THere may be so much information that sometimes I might forget something I had learned previously, but it's much easier to re-learn something through review.<br><br>
							There are enough pressures in life, I try my very best to not be my own worst enemy and put undue pressure on myself to succeed.  Hopefully this is a mindset I can keep throughout my time at DBC and beyond.

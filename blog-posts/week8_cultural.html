							Everyone deals with conflict, sometimes we deal with it every day of our life (I hope not).  The point is that it is commmon and learning how to deal with it, and more importantly how YOU deal with it is invaluable information which you can use to your advantage.<br><br>
							My last big conflict with someone probably would be with my fiance back when she was still just my girlfriend.  For a little background, I grew up and lived here in the San Francisco Bay Area and she had been living here for the past 5 years working in a biotech company.  She is originally from the Los Angeles area and her family still lives there.<br><br>
							Our conflict was this: she's always wanted to move back home when she starts a family, but all my family and friends are here.  This was a tough situation.  At that point we were very much committed to the relationship, but I had never even fathomed the idea of moving to LA.<br><br>
							What happened next was probably neither of our finest moments, we fought... a lot.  I just couldn't give in on this.  I felt like the rug had been pulled out from under me.  I met here here, our friends were here, if we moved to LA the only benefit would be to her, while I would get no benefit whatsoever.  There was no way I would move to LA.
							<br><br>
							The way we handled that conflict was to just calmly discuss it.  Arguing as you may have guessed was not a productive exercise.  When we sat down to discuss it I heard why it was so important.  She also heard my points as to why it made more sense for us to stay in the Bay Area.  What we ended up concluding was that at the time it would be a better idea for us to stay in the Bay Area and that I would be open for us to move to Los Angeles later when we were actually thinking about starting a family.
							<br><br>
							The funny thing about most conflicts is that most times we actually know the correct way to go about dealing with the conflict.  In our case, thoughtful discussion was a better idea than arguing and yelling at each other.  The problem is that sometimes our emotions can get ahold of us and we end up acting too rashly and not actually try to solve a conflict but just make sure the other person knows where we stand and stating that loudly.
							<br><br>
							My take away from that experience was that people rarely if ever can achieve thoughtful discussion while emotions are high.  I've tried to step away from the situation for awhile before I start talking.  If I had done that to begin with I think the conflict would have ended much faster and without hurting feelings.  
							<br><br>
							I'm glad we did go through that because I think it's shaped our future conflict resolution and made our relationship a lot smoother.

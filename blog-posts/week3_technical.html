							Why is it that we love javascript and that so many people use it today?  Any webpage you open probabably has some javascript component running in the background and these scripts are essential for creating a good user experience on a website.  <br><br>
							Part of this reason is somewhat circular: because all browsers support javascript.  Since all browsers are equipped to run javascript scripts it's easy to implement javascript in your website to create effects and interactive components to your website.  But how did this popularity begin?
							<br><br>
							First of all, javascript is fairly easy to learn.  The syntax although not quite as straightforward and easy as Ruby, is still simple.  Resources like Code Academy and Code Combat make learning javascript fun and easy.  
							<br><br>
							Secondly, since one of the biggest things we do is make plenty of mistakes, javascript makes it easy to fix errors and edit mistakes in your code.  It is easy to construct tests in javascript that will give you errors and exactly what the error is so that you can go back and edit your code to get a desired result.  
							<br><br>
							Third reason for javascript's popularity is its speed.  Javascript is classified as a "front-end language" which means in plain english that the code works on your computer and doesn't require your computer to constantly access a server across the internet to get more information on what to do next.  
							<br><br>
							Finally, with the influx of mobile devices and tablets, javascript is supported on all these devices meaning it is a great language to use to make aps.
							<br><br>
						</p>
						<p>
							Hovever, with all the advantages of javascript it does not come without disadvantages.  Because javascript is a "front-end language" you cannot use javascript to communicate with a server or write on a server without help from a server side scripting language.  
							<br><br>
							Therefore you cannot access databases on a server using javascript or get any information from the server without help from a server side script language.  
							<br><br>
							There are also security related limitations that don't allow javascript to access a client's computer or files 
						</p>
						<p>
							Despite all this, javascript is a great language to learn and by far has the most growth of any programming language today.  Learning javascript is a great tool for a beginning web developer and it looks like that wont change for awhile.

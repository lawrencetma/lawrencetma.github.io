						<p>
							Ahh.. I remember a simpler time when you didn't have to worry about margins, borders or padding.  But fear not, You don't have to worry about them now either!  Margins, Borders and Padding all surround an item in an HTML file but I'll show you exactly how.<br><br>
							<img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/D9nU6.gif">
							<br>
							Your content is being covered first by padding, or the space between the content and the border, then the border itself, and finally the margin which is the space that surrounds the border.
							<br><br>
							The easiest example I could come up with to illustrate this was some text with background color.  
							<br><br>
							<img src="http://img237.imageshack.us/img237/9595/paddingleft.png">
							<br><br>
							As you can see above, the word "content" is the content and the padding is the amount of space between the content and the border.
							In this case, to shrink the amount of red background color surrounding the word "content" you would simply reduce the amount of padding.  The blue area is the border itself and the light-blue is the margin.  Increasing the margin will make the content within it's border further from other elements or from the side of a page.  
							<br><br>
							The very best way to understand the differences of Margin, Border and Padding is to test it out yourself and play with changing the attributes of padding and margin to see how it affects the look of your website.  Have fun!

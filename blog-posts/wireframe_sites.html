					<h2>Barebones Sites</h2>
					<h3>Youtube</h3>
						<p>
							Youtube solves the problem of needing to watch media quickly and easily and probably solves some boredom as well
						</p>
						<p>
							Youtube faces a challenge of not giving too many options or too many video options all at once while still engaging the user so there are things he or she wants to watch front and center.

					<h3>Yahoo!</h3>
						<p>
							Yahoo! solves the problem of giving the user a lot of different types of content quickly and easily without bombarding them with useless information.
						</p>
						<p>
							In order to do this Yahoo must be very economical with the space it has on the front page and provide specific categories on the left sidebar while giving easily digestible front page stories that draw the user to click and find out more.
						</p>

						<h3>Craigslist</h3>
						<p>
							Craigslist solves the problem of providing classifieds to a region that has every category imaginable
						</p>
						<p>
							The problem that Craigslist encounters is trying to provide all these categories while making it very easy for a user to search the site and find exactly what they need in a short amount of time

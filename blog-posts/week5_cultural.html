							As I'm sure was the case with many other people starting phase 0 in DevBootcamp, I was pretty nervous about my first pairing session. What if I'm not ready for this?  What if the person thinks I'm a complete idiot? What if they're right?  These and many other questions ran through my head before pairing for the first time and thankfully I was given a pleasant dose of reality.<br><br>
							While DBC is full of very talented people, they are not so different from you.  They're here for some of the same reasons you are here, and simply want to learn.<br><br>
							During my time pairing with others I've had a great time getting to know my fellow students and realizing that we're all in the same boat and trying our best to complete challenges and learn in new and exciting ways.  When challenges were easily completed it was really fun to pat ourselves on the back and feel good about getting through it without any problems. When challenges were harder we didn't get frustrated but worked through the problems step by step and tried to disect what was wrong.  Once those tough challenges were finished though we had a great sense of relief and accomplishment.  I believe the comraderie formed when you and a pair can tackle a tough challenge together is extremely important and rewarding.<br><br>
							I hope I'm not just one of the lucky few, but I had great experiences with all my pairs and love working with all of them.  Despite all the good times I had, when feedback came into the feedback dashboard on Socrates I couldn't help but be a little nervous.<br><br>
							Maybe I was the only person who found the pair session rewarding.  Maybe the other person didn't think I offered much to the pair.  These were all definite possibilities but was again pleasantly surprised that I had nothing to worry about.  All my pairs were very gracious to me in their feedback and were very truthful as well.  I needed some work technically and that was reflected in their feedback, but that I contriubted in a positive way during my pairing sessions which is what I strive for.<br><br>
							Because of all the great constructive feedback I've been trying my best to provide feedback that is specific, actionable and kind.  My only problem so far is that sometimes I honestly have nothing actionable to talk about.  If there was nothing I deemed actionable in a pairing session I didn't think it was my duty to simply make something up and peg it as constructive criticism.  I just would say there was nothing actionable I could come up with and leave it as that.<br><br>
							In the cases I did have something actionable to say, one problem I had was to resist the urge to display that actionable input as what has been happily referred to as a "shit sandwich" and put it in between two praises of that person.  Or by reiterating that although they may have a deficiency that I have the same deficiency.  I don't think that it's an easy thing to do away with.  This comes with just the common courtesy you have grown to imploy in your everyday life.<br><br>
							As much as we can say that as long as you are specific, actionable and kind you do not need to employ any other methods to give criticism, it's still difficult to do when certain wording can still hurt feelings and that's not something anyone wants to do.<br><br>
							Overall I have had a great experience with pairing and I've been able to do a lot that I didn't think I was able to on my own.  Pairing also has helped me get into a comfort zone with the material knowing that there are other people struggling along with me and that ultimately I'm not doing this alone.<br><br>

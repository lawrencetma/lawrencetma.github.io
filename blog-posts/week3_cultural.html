							When I did my personal thinking style quiz I found out that my learning style was Abstract Random.  That assessment sounded pretty close to what I've known about myself already but was interesting to see it verified by the test.<br><br>
							According to the Gregorc thinking style, an Abbstract Random learner likes to listen to others, bringing group harmony to group situations, establishing healthy relationships and focusing on the issues at hand.
							<br><br>
							Also it states that Abstract Random learners like personal learning environments, and are able to participate in group activities and in a friendly manner.
							<br><br>
							So how does this help me?  A lot actually, it validates for me that I like group work and working in pairs which is a huge part of DBC.  Having guided pair sessions, and pair programming will be very beneficial for me in learning code in a way that matches my learning style.
							<br><br>
							However knowing what I know about the Growth vs Fixed mindset, I know that although I do lean towards being an Abstract Random thinker, it is not the only way I can learn and I could be able to incorpoate different ways of learning and get better at learning in other ways.
							<br><br>
							One thing I've already planned on doing is something we learned in the time management section we worked on last week.  One way I do learn well in is to simply sit and read, but I find it harder to concentrate than if I were in a group setting or working with a pair.  What I've been trying out is the Pomodoro Technique where I read for 25 minutes set to a timer then take a 5 minute break.  Somehow knowing that I will have a break and can do whatever I want for 5 minutes makes me focus better for those 25 minutes.
							<br><br>
							If I am able to learn in multiple modes and avenues then it makes my retention of knowledge that much easier.  Hopefully it's something I can improve on and use for a long time to come.

					<h2 id="post_head">Are Stereotype Threats Real?</h2>
						<p>
							Stereotype threat is a very interesting phenomenon that has been highlighted and studied by Dr. Claude Steele where minorities deal with a fear of succumbing to societal stereotypes.  The main stereotype that was studied was that black students do worse at tests or are somehow less intelligent than white students.  When Dr. Steele gave tests to black and white students and told them it was to measure intelligence, black students did considerably worse than the white students.  However when told that the test did not measure intelligence the black and white students performed equally.

							When researching this topic I constantly thought to myself, did I ever encounter stereotype threats in my life?  As a Chinese-American I encounter stereotypes all the time.  Chinese people are good at math, bad at driving and quiet.  But did any of these stereotypes change the way I performed at certain tasks?  
						</p>
						<p>
							The example I could think of was when I took my SAT's or SAT courses in high school.  The prevailing thought while I was in high school is that Asians scored well on the math portion of the SAT while we seemed to score badly on average on the English portion.  When I took the practice tests myself I found the same thing.  My math score was solid, but my english score was just average.  My white classmates seemed to experience an opposite effect, they knew that from statistics, Asians scored higher on math and on average my white classmates seemed to do worse on the math portion.<br><br>
							The high school I went to had a very even Asian to White ratio, and we made up 80% of our school population with about 40% of each.  I personally have no way of knowing whether my scores for English never seemed to match my math scores have anything to do with stereotype threat.  There could be a number of factors that contributed to it including the fact that my parents were born in Hong Kong and although they speak English very well, their vocabulary may not have been as great as my white classmates' parents.  In any case, it is an interesting topic to discuss, regardless of whether it contributed to my own performance in my academic past.

					<h3 id="post_head">Dealing With Threats</h3>
						<p>
							So what do we do if we feel like we or someone close to us is dealing with a stereotype threat?  The way that I would approach it is to realize that stereotype threat is a flaw in a person's mindset.  To me, even knowing the existence of this possible phenomenon made me think twice about how sometimes your own fears and self-doubt can be your own worst enemy.  How much have I or the people around me held ourselves back from accomplishing goals because we did not feel we had the ability or talent to do so?  Sometimes I believe that studies that display one race doing better than another race in a certain academic field can become some form of self-fulfilling prophecy.  
						</p>
						<p>
							I think all we can do is to spread the news of the myth that a certain racial group has some sort of proclivitiy for success in a certain area or subject and realize that we all have potential to do a variety of things well in our careers and in life.

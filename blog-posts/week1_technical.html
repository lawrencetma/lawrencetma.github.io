				<h2>The Best Websites in both Form and Function</h2>
					<p>
						For today's blog I'll be reviewing 3 of my favorite websites to visit and discussing their form and ease of use as well as their aesthetic qualities that make them look so appealing.<br>
						The 3 websites I chose to review are Youtube.com, Yahoo.com and Craigslist.org<br>
						<h3 id="post-heading">Youtube.com</h3>

							Youtube is obviously a very successful website and although some may say a lot has to do with it's content, but there are so many websites that provide you with user submitted videos, the reason Youtube has been so successful is the form of the website.  
						</p>
						<p>
							Youtube being an older website has gone through the usual growing pains of multiple looks in its history.  In the current format, Youtube has gone for a much more individual user centered website that is driven by your own watching habits.  You are encouraged to watch under a google account so that videos you watch can be recorded and quantified so that similar videos can be suggested to you.  On the front page you're given a few videos that you might like according to your viewing habits.
						</p>
						<p>
							What I really like is the simplistic style and the lack of clutter in the format.  You are given one video with a large preview picture and short description and then a few others.  Sites too often try to grab your attention in any way possible and attempt to bombard you with 20-30 videos on the same page.<br><br>Youtube has just a few to choose from in the beginning, with the channels you've subscribed to on the far left sidebar, and channels you might be interested on the far right sidebar
						</p>
						<p>
							Whether you're looking for something specific or just simply want to watch a few cat videos to pass the time, Youtube has everything you can think of in the realm of online videos.  With Youtube channels you are able to watch user created content that is increasing in overall quality every day.  Much of my time on Youtube is spent catching up on videos posted by my favorite channels.  
						</p>
						<p>
							Overall I love the clean and organized look of Youtube and the fact that my experience on the site is tailored to my own viewing habits.  
						<h3 id="post-heading">Yahoo.com</h3>
						<p>

						</p>
						<p>
							Yahoo! is meant for one thing, to be the front page of your internet experience. Open up your browser and the folks at Yahoo are hoping that their site has been programmed to be your default homepage.  It is for that reason that interesting news or pseudo-news stories are front and center.  Similar to the front page of a newspaper, the viewer wants the most important or attention grabbing stories on the front to encourage more traffic going throughout the site.
						</p>
						<p>
							Another great feature of Yahoo as with many other similar sites is the 'Trending Now' module on the upper right side.  You can instantly look at it and see what other people are searching for without any knowledge as to why.  That curiosity as to why these topics are trending causes viewers of the site including me to navigate those search terms to see what all the fuss is about.
						</p>
						<p>
							Yahoo! does a great job in also creating it's own content whether it be financial stories or sports news, Instead of relying on users, Yahoo! utilizes professional journalists so you don't have to wade through mediocre reporting from users to get to the real stories.
						</p>
						<p>
							Yahoo! is not quite as simplistic as Youtube, but it is still largely without clutter.  The "front page" story is usually either top news or the most interesting thing going on at that time and cycles through a list of top stories so you can navigate to the story that is most interesting to you.  
						</p>
						<p>
							Yahoo! has done a good job of handling the balance between providing the user with enough content to appeal to almost anyone, with the need to avoid clutter and to look clean.  It's probably the reason I've kept using Yahoo! as long as I have.
						</p>
						<h3 id="post-heading">Craigslist.org</h3>

						</p>
						<p>
							I love using craigslist because of the ease of navigation and the surprisingly uncluttered feel I get from a classifieds page that has many categories of items.
						</p>
						<p>
							Although Craigslist deals with so many different items for sale, job postings and housing postings, your eyes generally just follow the main headers before you dive into the smaller categorical links.  If you're looking for a job for example, you would look directly at the jobs headline and then look to see which categories that are located underneath it.  From the front page you make your selection and suddenly your job search has been narrowed down immediately to the job postings in the field of your choice.  
						</p>
						<p>
							I love craigslist mainly because it is so easy to use, both to browse the postings and to post as well.  As far as looks goes, Craigslist is about as barebones as it gets but everything is tailored towards ease of use.Categories are organized into neat columns and links are listed in alphabetical order.  There aren't a lot of competing colors that would make the links harder to read and there are no pictures on the front page.  
						</p>
						<p>
							Craigslist is about as simple as they come, but for the use it has, it's about as good as they come as well.

			<p id="posts">
				Sometimes you really never know where life will take you.  For me, I thought I knew exactly what I wanted to do: Go to law school, pass the bar, be a public interest attorney and save the world.  After 3 years of practicing I realized that being an attorney was not what I had envisioned at all and I was ready to make a huge change.
				<br><br>What I realized about myself is that I want to create things, have concrete results based work and be innovative and different.  None of these things were happening in my law career, but all of them can be achieved in web development.

				I was born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area and I absolutely love it here.  I'm a huge Giants fan and live and die on every game/pitch/inning.<br><br>Quirk: I was league champ in the 100 yard backstroke in high school
